# Virus-detection-processes
The script is design to detect unknown execuatable running on the windows using virustotal API

Just register to virustoal and get API key. Add the API key in the code and run main.py file.

It checks all the processes running on your PC and check their location. Then it converts into hashes to check in the virustotal website whether it is already flagged or not!

So you can quickly check whether executables are save or something wrong with them.

I also included whitelist.txt from my PC which are not having any virus. Your process will be updated on them, or you can empty them.
